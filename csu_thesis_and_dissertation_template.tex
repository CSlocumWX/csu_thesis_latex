% Options for the documentclass
% -----------------------------
% masters
%   including 'masters' will change 'Doctor of Philosophy'
%   to 'Master of Science' for the degree
% 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%   The title page, copyright page, and abstract are fixed at 12pt,
%   but you can change the body to one of three options
% times
%   Adobe Systems Utopia (1989) is the default serif font. Using
%   times will load mathptmx
% blue
%   makes the text for urls and references blue rather than black
%   requires the hyperref option
% smallfoot
%   makes the page number scriptsize rather than footnotesize
% nocopyright
%   CSU now requires the copyright page. If this changes, nocopyright
%   restores old format
